== Technical and crosscutting concepts

=== Mixin concept
Entities are from the start all the same. The actual functionaliy is based a a configuration in
link:../src/config/entities.js[Entity-config]. There the mixins are defined.

A workshop for instance can have a job (job-mixin), can have men (boss), can have smoke (smoke) and
at last does some default stuff for buildings (house).

  "workshop": {
    "needed": {
      "wood": 1,
      "stone": 1,
      "water": 1,
      "food": 1,
      "tool": 10
    },
    "production": {
      "tool": {
        "wood": 1,
        "stone": 1
      }
    },
    "mixins": [
      "boss",
      "job",
      "house",
      "smoke"
    ]
  },
