== Introduction & goals

Antargis.js should/will be a rewrite of https://github.com/godrin/antargis which had major drawbacks, being implemented in C++ and ruby.
This new version takes into account that the whole web-technology has gone through the roof and it's far enough to handle a
RTS-game on it's own.

So major goals in this rewrite are:

* give many devs the chance to collaborate (javascript is a well-known language)
* get players on board simply by surfing on the website - no downloads required
* include mobile users as well - simply by surfing on the site
* a possibility to generate apps from JS-code should still be kept in mind (webgl works on android, too)
